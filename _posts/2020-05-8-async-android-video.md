This week I had the chance to work with the awesome folks at [Async Android](https://twitter.com/AsyncAndroid) and uploaded my first youtube video.

In this video, we’ll see how we can find the theme attributes that control the appearance and feel of Android views such as Buttons, Seekbars, popup’s, dialogs, etc. By the end of the video, you’ll be able to answer questions such as how to change the font size or the text color and background color of a certain view.
