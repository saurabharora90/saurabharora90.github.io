My name is Saurabh Arora. I am a Google Developer expert for Android and currently I am working as a Senior Android Engineer @ Twitter, based out of Singapore.

Outside of work and meetups, I am a big tennis (read Federer) and cricket fan. I also like to keep myself fit through sports such as Tennis, Squash and Calisthenics.
